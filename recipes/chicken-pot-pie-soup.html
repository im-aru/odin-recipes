    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll pie crust into a 12-inch circle. Cut with a sharp knife or pizza cutter
        into 7 strips, then cut crosswise into 7 strips, discarding any scraps. You should have about 40 squares. Cover
        squares with plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>To form dumplings, working with 1 square at a time, lightly brush edges with water. Lift opposite corners to
        meet, then press to seal and form a triangle. Repeat with remaining squares, keeping dumplings covered with
        plastic wrap. </li>
      <li>Whisk together broth and condensed soup in a large Dutch oven. Stir in chicken, frozen vegetables, Italian
        seasoning, pepper, and garlic powder. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.
        Reduce heat to medium. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables and chicken are heated through,
        about 3 minutes. </li>
      <li>Gently stir dumplings into soup. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until dumplings are tender and soup
        is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Garnish servings with fresh thyme and additional pepper. </li>
    </ol>
